### DIGIT RECOGNIZER IN C ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
After **3 weeks** of work, I'm happy to present a program with an absolutely astonishing **24% accuracy** in recognizing handwritten digits.
I drew a lot of inspiration from the [Tsoding series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGSba51aRYU&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw) and [3B1Bseries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) on machine learning.

## Main Achievements
Beyond my ~~absolutely not trashy~~ digit recognizer, I also built:
- ðŸ§® A Matrix library
- ðŸ§  A Neural Network library
They're definitely not perfect, but *maybe* you'll find them useful!

## How to Run the Program
1. Download the project
2. Navigate to the ```bin```` directory
3. Run:
```bash
python3 "Digit Recognizer.py"
```
